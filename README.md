[Tech.io link](https://tech.io/playgrounds/51348/cgfunge-batch-runner)

This Java playground can help you to make faster tests on [CGFunge Primer puzzle](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/cgfunge-prime) 

It works by using the same code to a list of validators, giving you the number of valid tests, invalid ones, code coverage and a highlight of the first invalid execution.
